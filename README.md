# A Django applictaion to keep track of the daily tasks. 
## I have made this to learn django built-in classviews for efficient development.

<hr>

## I have not integrated CSS in this project yet. But it has fully functional backend.
1. Multiple user can register and data of every user is separated.
2. I have wrote additional logic to restrict one user to delete and see other user's data using URL.
3. User can do CRUD operations on their daily works.
